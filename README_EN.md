# 💻 Software Engineering for Your Body: The Preventive Movement Guide

> **"Don't spend the peak of your career 'debugging' your back and neck pain. Remember; if the hardware (body) crashes, the software (knowledge & skills) loses all its value."**

## 🚨 Why Are You Here? (The Painful Truth and Technical Debt)

As developers and office workers, while we build perfect architectures in the digital world, we leave our **biological machine** (the body) as a "legacy system."

You might not notice, but every day you sit at your desk, you are taking out **physical debt**. If:
* You only visit a doctor when a disc herniates or your fingers go numb,
* You spend your biological capital thinking "I'm only 25-30, nothing will happen,"
* You don't realize your cognitive performance is dropping because back pain prevents you from reaching Deep Sleep... **You are heading toward a major career disaster.**

## 📚 In-Depth Technical Modules (Navigation)

Our guide is modular, designed to optimize different layers of your body. You can "jump" directly to the module you need:

### 🏛️ Core Layers
* **[🧬 Physiology 101](docs/FIZYOLOJI_101.md)**: Anatomical analysis of the "Physical Debt" created by desk work. Start here to understand *why* you have pain.
* **[🪑 Ergonomics & Setup](docs/ERGONOMI.md)**: Design your workstation as a "Hardware Interface." A complete setup guide from monitor height to pelvic stabilization.

### 🏃 Movement & Repair
* **[🧘 Exercise Library](docs/EGZERSIZLER.md)**: Bio-mechanically focused movements tailored for developers. Each movement is a "unit test"; if you can't do it, there's a "bug" in your system.
* **[🕒 Daily Routines](docs/RUTINLER.md)**: Hourly "Anti-Sitting" micro-movements and post-work "Stabilization" protocols.

### 🧪 System Optimization
* **[🚀 Biohacking Guide](docs/BIOHACKING.md)**: Maximize your biological performance with metrics (HRV tracking, cold exposure, light management).
* **[🧠 Mental Health](docs/Zihin_SAGLIGI.md)**: Neuro-physiological strategies to protect "Deep Work" capacity and "Burnout" (System Overload) prevention techniques.
* **[💧 Nutrition & Hydration](docs/BESLENME_VE_HIDRASYON.md)**: Fuel management and caffeine strategies for brain performance (RAM) and focus.

### 🛡️ Security & Emergency
* **[👁️ Eye Health](docs/GOZ_SAGLIGI.md)**: Management of digital eye strain and techniques to "reset" eye focus muscles.
* **[🛠 Equipment Guide](docs/EKIPMAN_REHBERI.md)**: From foam rollers to massage balls, physical "upgrade" tools to support your posture.
* **[🚨 Emergency Hotfix](docs/ACIL_MUDAHALE.md)**: "Hotfix" - First-aid protocols for acute pain (locked back/stiff neck).

## 🛠 Core Approach: Physiotherapy-Focused Fitness (Prehab vs. Rehab)

The most common mistake is going to the gym and doing heavy workouts that further compress an already tight front chain (chest and shoulders) after 10 hours of hunching. This is **Prehabilitation (Pre-injury prevention)**, not Rehabilitation.

### 1. Proactive Physiotherapy: Pain is the Last Stop, Not the First Signal
* **Maintenance:** Optimizing a server before it crashes is what stretching and stabilizing your spine before it hurts is.

### 2. Posture Analysis: "The Tech Neck" Syndrome
A head constantly leaning forward increases the load on your cervical vertebrae by 3-4 times, leading to disc herniation and chronic headaches.

## 🏗 Project Roadmap

- [x] Basic Movement Protocol and Prehab Vision
- [x] Professionalization of all sub-content (TR/EN logic)
- [ ] **Body-as-a-Code (BaaC):** Automatic import of routines into calendars.
- [ ] **Developer Health Dashboard:** A template to track your own data.
